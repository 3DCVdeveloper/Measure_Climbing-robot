Wall climbing robot for crack detection in concrete buildings

A wall climbing detection robot has been developed that can stably adsorb and walk on concrete building walls, navigate to crack locations, and perform real-time recognition and data recording. To replace manual operation and improve detection accuracy and efficiency, providing a new and efficient detection solution for engineering fields such as construction and water conservancy. The implementation of this system function is achieved through the use of a wall climbing robot designed with negative pressure adsorption, equipped with an Obi Gemini2 camera that enables the robot to obtain real-time images. The data is processed using the powerful computing power of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano to identify and record cracks on the surface of concrete buildings in real time.
